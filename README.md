# DevOps

## Project Goals
1. Create my ideal codebase to "lift and shift" a startup or small organization into AWS and EKS
1. Using minimal number tools with high market share utilization (eg terraform, eksctl, helm)
1. Demo with k8s nginx welcome page

## Architectural Overview

### Org and Accounts
<p align="center"><img src="drawings/org-and-account-layout.drawio.png"/></p>

The organization, organization units, and accounts layout is designed in accordance to the documented best practices for OUs in the [AWS Organizations User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous_best_practices.html). This codebase is can be expanded to accommodate additional OUs such as Sandbox, Suspended, Exceptions, etc.

### VPC Options

#### Failover

| Failover Enabled | Failover Disabled |
| :-: | :-: |

The Virtual Private Cloud and Transit Gateway layout is designed in accordance to the Hub and Spoke model in the [Building a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network Infrastructure Whitepaper](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/building-scalable-secure-multi-vpc-network-infrastructure/transit-gateway.html).

- Service Endpoints are shared to the entire Organization through the Network VPCs and Transit Gateways
- Private R53 zone `internal.` is attatched to the Network VPCs providing standard human-readable DNS for the Endpoints
- SDLC Accounts have Network VPC shared to keep down cost

##### Options

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `network_tgw_share_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Network TGW will be shared to this account. |
| `network_vpc_endpoint_services_enabled` | list(string) | `[""]` | Which endpoint services are attached to the Network VPC and shared through the TGW. |
| `network_vpc_share_enabled` | boolean | `false` | Network VPC will be shared to this account. |
| `vpc_cidr_substitute` | string | `""` | A VPC will be provisioned in the Primary region with the specified CIDR. |
| `vpc_cidr_substitute_failover` | string | `""` | A VPC will be provisioned in the Failover region with the specified CIDR. |

In the Failover Enabled diagram above the following options are defined:

| Account | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Network | `network_vpc_endpoint_services_enabled`, `vpc_cidr_substitute`, `vpc_cidr_substitute_failover` |
| SDLC | `network_vpc_share_enabled` |
| CustomerA | `network_tgw_share_enabled`, `vpc_cidr_substitute`, `vpc_cidr_substitute_failover` |
| CustomerB | `network_tgw_share_enabled`, `vpc_cidr_substitute` |
| CustomerC |  |

In the Failover Disabled diagram above the following options are defined:

| Account | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Network | `network_vpc_endpoint_services_enabled`, `vpc_cidr_substitute` |
| SDLC | `network_vpc_share_enabled` |
| CustomerA | `network_tgw_share_enabled`, `vpc_cidr_substitute` |
| CustomerB | `network_tgw_share_enabled`, `vpc_cidr_substitute` |
| CustomerC |  |

#### Subnet HA

| Five Nines | Four Nines |

| <img src="drawings/vpc-subnet-layout-five9s.drawio.png" width="400"/> | <p align="center"><img src="drawings/vpc-subnet-layout-four9s.drawio.png" width="400"/> |

Virtual Private Cloud Subnet layout is designed to provide 99.999% ("Five Nines") availability using 3 Subnets across 3 Availability Zones as per the [recommendations and best practices for ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-availability-best-practices/). Although the blog contains best practices for *ECS*, the same logic for providing 99.999% availability applies to EKS, RDS, S3, etc. This codebase also can be configured to provide 99.99% ("Four Nines") availability using 2 Subnets across 2 Availability Zones as a cost savings option by setting `foo = false`. This codebase will not provide 99.9999% ("Six Nines") availability using 4 Subnets across 4 Availability Zones is not in the scope of this codebase for various reasons, most noteably because AWS

## To-Do
- need to expand IAM into new customer accounts and SDLC
- reorg the sdlc accounts unerneath the workloads ou / sdls ou
   - make customera ou
- need to share network VPC to sdlc
- need code for share_vpc and share_tgw
- need tags_all to populate tags in non-SDLC accounts for EKS requirements
- sdlc needs an elegant way to create DNS records to point to VPC endpoints in the shared network VPC
   - needs to support multi-regional failover as well
   - just start with making R53 entries first, this may be all that is needed
- Federated login for devops, operations, and developers
   - https://getstarted.awsworkshop.io/02-dev-fast-follow/02-federated-access-to-aws/02-aws-sso-ad.html
   - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/field-notes-integrating-active-directory-federation-service-with-aws-single-sign-on/
   - Also need Windows Admin Server in some account
   - Goal is to have everyone log in to SSO and their priviledges to log in and assume roles will dynamically populate based on their groups in AD
   - might need to make a separate DOMAIN.TLD for services like clientVPN and enterprise AD domains if any
- Triggering a DR event
   - ACL allows no traffic in one subnet
- Implement backend tfstate lock with dynamodb
   - need bucket, table, and access set up uniquely for superadmin and automation users
- Complete sdlc dev, tst, and stg
- Need scalable solution to deploy security settings such as aws_ebs_snapshot_block_public_access, block public s3 access, default ebs encryption, etc
   - probably need a step after account creation before iam to deploy org-security-settings
- Opt out of all AI policy https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_ai-opt-out.html
- Implement Rust server
- Implement the Well-Architected Tool https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html
- Complete some kind of automation to convert drawings into png for this documentation
- Base docker images for all distros
   - initially just docker images which run apt-get upgrade or yum upgrade to get patches

- EKS autoscaling examples
   - CPU
   - Sessions
- SCP enforcing features

   - Disable unlimited burstable instance credits
   - delete all default VPCs in all regions of every account
- AWS Backup with Multi-AZ and glacier
- MFA enforced organization-wide
- AD
   - Update directory AD and client VPN so groups in AD manage network access to AWS environments
   - Add Windows Server 2019 cheap instance to Directory for AD administration
- move desired R53 healthcheck source locations to a var and local design
- ALB sec group with cool way of allowing ingress (nonprod through private CVPN, prod through public)
- Mozilla Secrets OPerationS (SOPS) protects secrets in code using Key Management System (KMS) Customer Managed Key (CMK)
- break glass entry for accounts https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/break-glass-access.html
- AWS config for hipaa, CIS, NIST
