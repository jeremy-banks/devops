# To-Do
- Complete sdlc dev, tst, and stg
   - need code for share_vpc and share_tgw
   - sdlc needs an elegant way to create DNS records to point to VPC endpoints in the shared network VPC
      - needs to support multi-regional failover as well
      - just start with making R53 entries first, this may be all that is needed
- Federated login for devops, operations, and developers
   - https://getstarted.awsworkshop.io/02-dev-fast-follow/02-federated-access-to-aws/02-aws-sso-ad.html
   - https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/field-notes-integrating-active-directory-federation-service-with-aws-single-sign-on/
   - Also need Windows Admin Server in some account
   - Goal is to have everyone log in to SSO and their priviledges to log in and assume roles will dynamically populate based on their groups in AD
   - might need to make a separate DOMAIN.TLD for services like clientVPN and enterprise AD domains if any
   - AD
      - Update directory AD and client VPN so groups in AD manage network access to AWS environments
      - Add Windows Server 2019 cheap instance to Directory for AD administration
- Triggering a DR event
   - ACL allows no traffic in one subnet
   - EKS autoscaling examples
      - CPU
      - Sessions
- StackSet Deployments
   - Disable unlimited burstable instance credits
   - delete all default VPCs in all regions of every account
   - AWS config for hipaa, CIS, NIST
      - aggregate to security account probably
   - AWS Backup with Multi-AZ and glacier
   - SCP enforcing features
      - S3 buckets never public
      - aws_ebs_snapshot_block_public_access
      - block public s3 access
- Implement the Well-Architected Tool https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/organizing-your-aws-environment.html
- Base docker images for all distros
   - initially just docker images which run apt-get upgrade or yum upgrade to get patches
- Implement Rust server
- Complete some kind of automation to convert drawings into png for this documentation
- Centralized logging with compression and glacier archive
   - DNS logs sent to CloudWatch Log Group and S3 (with cross-regional replication and glacier)
   - ALB logs send to CloudWatch Log Group and S3 (with cross-regional replication and glacier)
- Mozilla Secrets OPerationS (SOPS) protects secrets in code using Key Management System (KMS) Customer Managed Key (CMK)
- break glass entry for accounts https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/organizing-your-aws-environment/break-glass-access.html
- ALB sec group with cool way of allowing ingress (nonprod through private CVPN, prod through public)
- MFA enforced organization-wide
